# Children's Theme Index

The Children's Theme Index is a set of local subject headings and form terms used to describe works of fiction in the [Children's Collection](https://www.strath.ac.uk/professionalservices/library/researchrevise/collections/childrenscollection/) in the University of Strathclyde's Andersonian Library.

The records are created in Excel and converted to MARC format in [MarcEdit](https://marcedit.reeset.net/), using the Delimited Text Translator tool. The binary MARC files are then imported to our LMS (Alma) as authority records. The latest versions of the records are deposited here in Excel (.xlsx), comma-separated (.csv), binary MARC (.mrc), mnemonic MARC text (.mrk), and MARCXML (.xml) formats.

The Children's Theme Index is managed by the Library's Cataloguing and Metadata team. The team undertook a complete review of the index in 2023, which involved replacing outdated terminology and adding new headings for subjects which were previously poorly represented. The index is designed to be used with a specific collection at Strathclyde, but we have made it freely available here for anyone else who may find it useful. We welcome any suggestions, comments or questions about the Children's Theme Index. Submissions can be made using [this form](https://forms.office.com/e/uGXaBM2EKq) or by emailing [lib.bcd@strath.ac.uk](mailto:lib.bcd@strath.ac.uk).
